# DistanceARUnity
A Unity Project in AR that mesures the distance of plans and displays it

# How it works
The app allows you to see the distance between you a chosen recognized plan, using a target and a button for visual plan selection. It will shoot a raycast in the chosen direction to evaluate the distance.
